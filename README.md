# ITunesMVC

Consume ITunes API to get more popular apps

This is a educational demo how to show the most popuplar apps in ITunes through a List. We get the information from ITunes Webservice, parsing the JSON response and finally showing the information. We avoid to use boilerplate code with the help of libraries such as Android Annotations.
